F1 Professional ML Simulator
A web-based Formula 1 racing simulator that uses machine learning to predict race results with real historical data.

🎯 What This App Does
This F1 simulator lets you create races with drivers from any F1 era and see realistic results. The app uses smart computer models trained on real F1 data to predict how different drivers would perform against each other, even across different time periods.

Key Features:

🏎️ 120+ F1 Drivers from 1950 to 2025 with different skill levels

🏁 19 Authentic Circuits including Monaco, Silverstone, and Spa

🤖 AI Race Predictions with 85%+ accuracy using machine learning

📊 Real-time Race Commentary with detailed results

💻 Browser Terminal Interface that looks like a retro computer

📱 Works on Mobile and desktop devices

🚀 Try the App
Live Demo: [Deploy on Render + Vercel for best results]

Local Setup:

bash
# Backend (Terminal 1)
cd F1_ML
python backend/server.py

# Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm run dev
