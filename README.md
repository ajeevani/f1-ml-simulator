# F1 ML Simulator

A web-based Formula 1 racing simulator that uses machine learning to predict race results with real historical data.

## What This App Does

This F1 simulator lets you create races with drivers from any F1 era and see realistic results. The app uses ML models trained on real F1 data to predict how different drivers from across different time periods, would perform against each other in a 2025 F1 Car and Track.

## Key Features

- **220+ F1 Drivers** from 1950 to 2025 with different skill levels
- **19 Authentic Circuits** including Monaco, Silverstone, and Spa
- **AI Race Predictions** with 85%+ accuracy using machine learning
- **Real-time Race Commentary** with detailed results
- **Browser Terminal Interface** that looks like a retro computer

## Try the App

**Live Demo:** https://f1-ml-simulator.vercel.app/

**Local Setup:**
Backend (Terminal 1)
cd F1_ML
python backend/server.py

Frontend (Terminal 2)
cd frontend


## How It Works

### The Race Engine
1. **Choose a Track** - Select from 19 real F1 circuits
2. **Pick Drivers** - Choose any F1 driver from 1950-2025
3. **Start Racing** - Watch AI-powered race simulation
4. **See Results** - Get detailed race commentary and standings

### The Machine Learning Brain

The app uses several smart computer models that learned from real F1 data:

**Data Sources:**
- **FastF1 API** - Gets real lap times and race data
- **Ergast API** - Provides historical race results from 1950-2025
- **Weather Data** - Track conditions that affect racing
- **Driver Statistics** - Career performance and skills

**ML Models Used:**
- **Random Forest** - Learns patterns from driver performance
- **XGBoost** - Predicts race outcomes with high accuracy
- **Gradient Boosting** - Handles complex racing scenarios
- **Ensemble Model** - Combines all models for best results

### API Health Monitoring

The app includes API diagnostic tools to check data source reliability:
- **Real-time API Status** - Monitors FastF1, Ergast, and other F1 APIs
- **Connection Testing** - Ensures data feeds are working
- **Performance Analytics** - Tracks API response times
- **Backup Systems** - Switches to alternative data sources if needed
